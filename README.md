## ⚙️ Rendering Instructions

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# Mac/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate

# Install requirements
pip install manim gTTS
sudo apt install ffmpeg ```  # required for merging

2️⃣ Generate Animations
# for high quality
manim -pqh intro_video.py OpeningBranding
manim -pqh intro_video.py PersonalIntroduction
manim -pqh intro_video.py ClosingBranding

#for low quality
manim -pql intro_video.py OpeningBranding
manim -pql intro_video.py PersonalIntroduction
manim -pql intro_video.py ClosingBranding


👉 Outputs will be saved in:
media/videos/intro_video/1080p60/

3️⃣ Generate Voiceovers
python generate_voiceover.py


👉 Creates:

assets/audio/voiceover_opening.mp3

assets/audio/voiceover_intro.mp3

assets/audio/voiceover_closing.mp3

4️⃣ Merge Video + Audio
python combine_videos.py


👉 Final video saved to:
outputs/videos/final_intro_video.mp4

👉 Final video saved to:
outputs/videos/final_intro_video.mp4


⚡ Challenges & Solutions
1. ⏱️ Syncing Animations with Voiceover

Problem: Text animations had fixed wait times, narration varied

Solution: Split narration into 3 scenes + used FFmpeg’s -shortest flag

2. 🎨 Making Animations Look Professional

Problem: Default fade-ins felt flat

Solution: Added particles, floating effects, and gradient text

3. 📂 Managing Multiple Files

Problem: Tracking 3 scenes + 3 voiceovers + merges

Solution: Automated pipeline with temp folder & concat file

4. 🖥️ Performance & Rendering Speed

Problem: High-quality Manim renders are slow

Solution: Used -pqh (preview high) for testing, -qh for final renders

🎯 Final Deliverable

✅ High-quality MP4 intro video: outputs/videos/final_intro_video.mp4

✅ Smooth animations synced with narration

✅ Consistent branding & modular design

✅ Easy to update narration, logo, or animation styles
